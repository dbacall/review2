apply filter to change how track sounds
write a band pass filter:
- takes a sound wave
- sound wave - lower limit and upper limit
soundwave = [80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
array of 5
low pass filter - sets any fequency below 
filtered with lower limit 90, higher limit 110 [90, 90, 100, 110, 110]

[60, 90] => [70, 90]
